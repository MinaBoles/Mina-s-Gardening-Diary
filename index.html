            <p class="content">
                In 2018 I had a back injuiry and this resulted in me being a wheelchair bound. It is incredible how we
                can adapt to new life styles. Having lost the ability to walk ,and all function in my left side,  I could not do the things I loved anymore such as; walking, cycling and running. So, I took up gardening as a hobby after spending just over 4
                months in hospital.
<br><br>
                Everything was extremely hard at the beginning; accessibility issues , handling and carrying isssues , reaching the ground to sow, and above all I had zero experience in gardening.
                <br><br>
                I started following some gardening accounts on Instagram , and it seemed that everyone had green
                fingers. But soon after, I was hit by the reality and most of my plants died. I almost gave up but with
                several attempts and perseverance I succeeded and things started to flourish. 
            <br> <br>
                I learned the lesson; that I will never ever give up. If I can do it , so could you!
